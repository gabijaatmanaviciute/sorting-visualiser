/*
MERGE SORT:
* Divide:  Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided. 
* Conquer:  Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm. 
* Merge:  The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. 
* The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.
