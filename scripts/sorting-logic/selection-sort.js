/*
SELECTION SORT:
* First we find the smallest element and swap it with the first element. This way we get the smallest element at its correct position.
* Then we find the smallest among remaining elements (or second smallest) and swap it with the second element.
* We keep doing this until we get all elements moved to correct position.
