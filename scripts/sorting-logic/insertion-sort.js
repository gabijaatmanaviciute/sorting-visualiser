/*
INSERTION SORT:
* We start with the second element of the array as the first element is assumed to be sorted.
* Compare the second element with the first element if the second element is smaller then swap them.
* Move to the third element, compare it with the first two elements, and put it in its correct position
* Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
