/*
HEAP SORT:
* Rearrange array elements so that they form a Max Heap.
* Repeat the following steps until the heap contains only one element:
* Swap the root element of the heap (which is the largest element in current heap) with the last element of the heap.
* Remove the last element of the heap (which is now in the correct position). 
* We mainly reduce heap size and do not remove element from the actual array.
* Heapify the remaining elements of the heap.
* Finally we get sorted array.
